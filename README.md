## Topic: Predicting Student Depression Using Machine Learning

This Project focuses on predicting the likelihood of depression among students by applying different algorithms **"Machine Learning Algorithms"**.
Essentially, I applied Logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) models to analyze the student data and predict the signs of depression.


## âœ¨ Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning of the student dataset
- Implementation of **Logistic Regression**
- Implementation of **SVM**
- Performance comparison between models  
- Visualizations for better understanding of results
