# Statistics-For-Data-Science-Project

This Project focuses on predicting the likelihood of depression among students by using **"Machine Learning Algorithms"**.
Basically, I applied **Linear Regression** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** models to analyze the student data and predict the signs of depression.


## âœ¨ Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning of the student dataset
- Implementation of **Linear Regression**
- Implementation of **SVM**
- Performance comparison between models  
- Visualizations for better understanding of results
